### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

This coding challenge was interesting as I like that there are many ways that it can be tackled. My first iteration of the problem is the final of what I have right now, and my second iteration was very different take. I used ternary operators and was able to use those instead of if statements, but despite not having any if's on the screen I think that this version is easier to read. 

Both of my versions had the same logic with 6 different statements that condensed the nested if statements in an attempt to reduce the amount of if's. At the beginning of the code I started with the error catcher to prevent the computer from running and checking every statement when the numbers entered by the user are invalid. Coding everything was going well until I encountered a problem with the conditionals of Stage 2 Hypertension and Hypertensive Crysis, the problem was that I used s > 140 and didn't use a upper limit so although I was testing with blood pressure levels that were obviously a crysis I was still getting Stage 2. By adding <= 180 my issue was resolved and everything was working to my design. 

While I am confident on this solution, I do think there might be better ways to condense the If statements by using logical operators to merge the statements together but I wasn't succesful in my attempts to do so.
